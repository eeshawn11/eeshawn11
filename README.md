## Hi there 👋

I am a full-time Data Science Immersive graduate from General Assembly Singapore and excited to join the data community. Coming from a Hospitality background, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL as I navigate my way thorugh these uncharted waters.

📸: Fun fact: I enjoy photography as a hobby, especially while travelling. Check out some of my photos [here](https://eeshawn.tumblr.com) and [there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ee_shawn/).
