## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science Immersive graduate from General Assembly Singapore and new to the data community! Coming from a Hospitality background, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL as I navigate my way thorugh these uncharted waters.

:camera_flash: Fun fact: I enjoy photography as a hobby, especially while travelling. Check out some of my photos [here](https://eeshawn.tumblr.com) and [there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ee_shawn/).

## <img src="./general-assembly-space-academy.png" alt="General Assemly Logo" height="20"> [Data Science Immersive Projects](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI33-Shawn)
A collection of various projects completed during my 12 week immersive with General Assembly.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Regression, classification and ensemble modelling with `scikit-learn`
- Collaboration and version control with `git`
- Presentation of findings and recommendations at the end of each project

### :surfer: [Capstone - Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI-Capstone)
Capstone project from Data Science Immersive. Trained an image caption generator with attention mechanism that achieved a BLEU-1 score of 0.52 on the [Flickr30k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eeshawn/flickr30k) dataset, deployed using [Streamlit](https://eeshawn-dsi-capstone.streamlit.app/).

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing with `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
- Handling of large dataset using TensorFlow's tf.data API

## :roller_coaster: Side Projects
Some random projects that I have been working on during my free time.

### :office: [HDB Resale Price Dashboard](https://github.com/eeshawn11/HDB_Resale_Dashboard)
Exploration of data retrieved from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/), in particular HDB resale prices from 2012, to create an interactive dashboard. I am also hopeful that any insights gleaned could be helpful to my own HDB purchase journey, but no fancy prediction model here (yet?), just some charts and maps.

This is an ongoing project to document my learning with using Streamlit and various Python libraries. While such a dashboard could perhaps be more easily created using PowerBI or Tableau, I am also taking the opportunity to explore the various Python plotting libraries and understand their documentation.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Data extraction from live Data.gov.sg API
- Data transformation with `pandas`
- Data visualisation with `Vega-Altair` and `Plotly`
- Python web app deployment with [`streamlit`](https://eeshawn-hdb-resale.streamlit.app/)
