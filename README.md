## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science Immersive graduate from General Assembly Singapore and new to the data community! Coming from a Hospitality background, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL as I navigate my way thorugh these uncharted waters.

ðŸ“¸: Fun fact: I enjoy photography as a hobby, especially while travelling. Check out some of my photos [here](https://eeshawn.tumblr.com) and [there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ee_shawn/).

## :roller_coaster: Side Projects
Some random projects that I have been working on during my free time.

### :office: [HDB Resale Price Dashboard](https://github.com/eeshawn11/HDB_Resale_Dashboard)
Using data retrieved from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/), I created a dashboard to visualise HDB resale price trends and choloropeths of the island state. No fancy prediction model here (yet?), just some charts and maps.
