## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a full-time Data Science Immersive student with General Assembly Singapore and excited to join the data community. Coming from a Hospitality background, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL as I navigate my way thorugh these uncharted waters.
