## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science Immersive graduate from General Assembly Singapore and new to the data community! Coming from a Hospitality background, this has been quite a major shift in my career trajectory, but I've been fully enjoying my time picking up new skills like Python and SQL as I navigate my way through these uncharted waters.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-sing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="./linkedin_original.svg" alt="LinkedIn Logo" height="18"/></a> Happy to connect on LinkedIn, and also currently actively looking for my next role. ðŸ˜‰

:camera_flash: Fun fact: I enjoy photography as a hobby, especially while travelling. Check out some of my photos [here](https://eeshawn.tumblr.com) and [there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ee_shawn/).

### :office: [HDB Resale Price Dashboard](https://github.com/eeshawn11/HDB_Resale_Dashboard)

Exploration of data retrieved from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices), in particular HDB resale prices from 2012, to create an interactive dashboard. I am also hopeful that any insights gleaned could be helpful to my own HDB purchase journey, but no fancy prediction model here (yet?), just some charts and maps.

This is an ongoing project to document my learning with using Streamlit and various Python libraries. While such a dashboard could perhaps be more easily created using PowerBI or Tableau, I am also taking the opportunity to explore the various Python plotting libraries and understand their documentation.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://eeshawn-hdb-resale.streamlit.app/)

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Data extraction through live Data.gov.sg API
- Data transformation with `pandas`
- Working with geospatial data using OneMap [API](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/docs/), `Shapely` and `Mapbox`
- Data visualisation with `Vega-Altair` and `Plotly`
- Web app deployment with `streamlit`

### :electric_plug: [Electricity Demand Forecasting with Prophet](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Time-Series-Forecasting)

Time series forecast using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eeshawn/half-hourly-electrical-demand-in-singapore) gathered from the [Energy Market Authority](https://www.ema.gov.sg/index.aspx) of Singapore. The original data is stored in individual weekly Excel files by month and year, which I have scraped from the website and combined into a dataset.

This is a relatively straightforward univariate time series problem involving electricity demand in Singapore and Prophet achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of **3.67%** when predicting for demand in January 2023.

[![Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/eeshawn/time-series-forecasting-with-prophet)

Skills Demonstrated:

- Extracting data through Web scraping with `Selenium`
- Data transformation with `pandas`
- Loading and storing data into `Kaggle` dataset
- Time series forecast with Facebook `Prophet`

### :fist: [Naruto Hand Seals - Gesture Recognition](https://huggingface.co/eeshawn11/naruto_hand_seal_detection)

Training and deploying a machine learning model that can recognise 12 basic hand seals from the Naruto anime using transfer learning with YOLOv8.

[![Open in Spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/open-in-hf-spaces-sm.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eeshawn11/naruto_hand_seals)

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Collecting and building my own dataset using `OpenCV`
- Image annotation with `LabelImg`
- Transfer learning using a pre-trained `YOLOv8` model

A collection of various projects completed during my 12-week immersive with General Assembly.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Supervised machine learning with `scikit-learn`, with a variety of regression, classification and ensemble models
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with `NLTK`
- Presentation of findings and recommendations at the end of each project
- Collaboration and version control with `git`

### :surfer: [Capstone - Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI-Capstone)

Capstone project from Data Science Immersive. Trained an image caption generator with attention mechanism that achieved a BLEU-1 score of 0.52 on the [Flickr30k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eeshawn/flickr30k) dataset.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://eeshawn-dsi-capstone.streamlit.app/)

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing with `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
- Handling of large dataset using TensorFlow's tf.data API
- Deployment of custom Keras model to `streamlit` web app

### :running: [Running Man](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man)

Developed a game to familiarise with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and working with Classes. While the game concept was simple, it was interesting figuring out how to code various aspects of the game, such as collision detection and handling user input.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Designing and coding game mechanics with `PyGame`, such as collision detection
- `Object-Oriented Programming`in Python
- Program testing and debugging

<!--
To-do list.
- Work on a GitHub Pages to showcase projects
- Include more images.
